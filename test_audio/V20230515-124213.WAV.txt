 And it didn't turn out well at all.
 Don't be shy Malik. Get yourself enough food.
 Did y'all do a dinner at your house Malik this
 morning?
 Or Brian's or something?
 Kind of.
 You're welcome man. Right here.
 We did. Thanks coach.
 Well, I got up at 7 and worked on church.
 Tried to take a nap, but I got so much to do.
 I got up at 3.30 cause I really wanted to.
 Oh well, I didn't go to bed until 4.
 I didn't go to bed until about 2 and I got up at
 3.30 and 8.
 Oh.
 I got shit on me.
 If you could keep moving that squash down that
 this way it would be appreciated.
 Oh yeah.
 Ew. What's in there?
 Yeah, what's in there?
 What's in there?
 I don't know.
 She's very positive.
 Not sure whether we want to try that or not.
 What is it?
 It's probably gluten-free stuffing.
 Oh.
 But one time we ate uh...
 stuffing. That was the best.
 Okay.
 Is that the cornmeal based?
 Yeah, it was like stuffing.
 It seemed like it would go together if you had it
 in your hand.
 It was so good.
 Did we make that?
 So maybe next year we'll have a team where we all
 bring the stuffing together.
 Oh yeah.
 I would be so mad.
 Sorry.
 I tried to get a taste of it.
 It's very good.
 Yeah.
 That's not bad.
 Is that a cat?
 Where's your cat, Germany?
 What? Where's your cat?
 Hiding.
 She came out and showed her face and then she
 went and ran away again.
 Cooking her kale the whole time.
 Yeah.
 So then I actually got her to come out and talk
 to her last time.
 We were all together.
 Yeah.
 She was. She did. She did a good job.
 Oh, then thank you very much.
 We got yelled at a couple times about jumping on
 the table and then she disappeared.
 Then she came back out again.
 But I was running around and I didn't see her.
 And then about the second time the door opened
 she disappeared and I didn't see her.
 Put your phone away.
 I'll just turn it off.
 Thank you.
 That had to be Lucas.
 He's closest to the remote.
 Do you turn the TV on?
 Oh, I just nosed it.
 Do you want it off?
 It's okay, David.
 I looked for the fireplace thingy that we had on
 the one-year.
 I didn't realize there was football on today.
 I should have realized there's always football.
 It's a big day for football.
 I thought that was Thanksgiving.
 It is, though.
 I'm tired.
 I was like, "Is that a day?"
 Oh, Netflix is trying to get into the football
 streaming stuff now, too?
 Yeah.
 They're kind of overreacting that you watch game
 football.
 They're kind of overreacting that you watch game
 football.
 They're kind of overreacting that you watch game
 football.
 Anytime you turn the TV on, there's football.
 Anytime you turn the TV on, there's football.
 Are you a big football fan, Nicolette?
 Are you a big football fan, Nicolette?
 Yeah.
 I guess it's a Matt's big brother, then.
 Yeah.
 He's like me here.
 He's like me here.
 He's like me here.
 He's like me here.
 He's like me here.
 That's what we are.
 That's what we are.
 I'm going to wash up and eat or whatever from the
 store.
 [chatter]
 [chatter]
 [chatter]
 [chatter]
 Fancy potato banana.
 [chatter]
 [laughter]
 Yeah, that was good.
 Little gas. Yep.
 The final touch, right?
 I don't know.
 What are you doing here?
 [sneezes]
 [chatter]
 [chatter]
 [chatter]
 Oh no.
 [chatter]
 [chatter]
 [chatter]
 [laughter]
 Yeah. It's mine.
 That was far worse than mine.
 I don't know.
 So much blood.
 Hmm?
 Take care of your swiped face.
 Oh, yeah.
 I feel like you've got a red on your face.
 I'm not.
 You've got a red on your face.
 I have a whole...
 Two-thirds of my face is red.
 That's a lot.
 There's a plate next to her.
 There seems to be another plate next to her.
 I don't know, but...
 It's full of pink stuff.
 Surprise.
 But I was being asked for another plate
 and we didn't have enough plates on the table.
 So I was trying to figure out
 where that other plate was.
 This was the extra plate.
 Yeah, well...
 Kendall has one next to her
 that's full of pink stuff.
 Oh, wow.
 Yeah.
 Last time, both of them went into the kitchen
 and got an extra paper plate
 for their extra pink stuff.
 Oh, he took the whole bowl home with him.
 And I put a box...
 I stopped him and got a box
 for all the pink stuff.
 And what you look for later on
 is a hullabaloo
 of everybody taking their extra pink stuff home.
 My box of pink stuff.
 I know.
 It's good, man.
 Well, that's how we're gonna try it.
 You can pass that down this way, Kendall.
 I haven't tried that yet.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, it's a gluten-free dressing, right?
 Oh, the mac and cheese is good.
 The mac and cheese is great.
 I threw a little bit of pepper jack in there.
 Oh, really? Cool.
 I like that.
 This is cool.
 Very cool.
 I didn't eat anything today,
 but I ate a lot last night.
 Do you want to do this?
 I would try it.
 Well, I would try it,
 but I can't.
 I can't fit all of this in my...
 Oh, that's tasty.
 I have a couple more boxes of that at home.
 Wow.
 And then I was kind of like,
 "Right, now I'm that person."
 And the cleaning up at the kitchen
 is part of it, wasn't it?
 The science experiments that were going on
 and the...
 I did that before you guys had gone on the
 project.
 ...yesterday, so then I would have...
 That's a terrible pineapple upside down.
 He was convinced...
 One can.
 We're getting worse.
 No, I wouldn't.
 I'm going to eat that.
 I don't know what's going on.
 Can you try one of those things?
 That makes me...
 I'm going to put one of these on TV.
 You know what's fun?
 Shall we put them on air?
 You've got to be personal with them.
 They're right for the turn.
 At least this paint is just a scram.
 A light layer.
 And when you go to wash the suns out
 and you look at the scene,
 you can see that it's all over the area.
 You can see?
 Well, I found that when you turn a pan
 and you turn it on,
 I've never even...
 I've never even...
 I've never even...
 I've never even...
 I've never even...
 You know, I've only...
 I've never even...
